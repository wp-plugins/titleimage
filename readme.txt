This plugin displays a manually or randomly selected image of a chosen gallery from the great plugin NextGEN Gallery.

== Description ==

This plugin is just as simple as it sounds. If you already use the fabulous plugin [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) than the titleimage plugin gives you the possibility to display the first or a random image from a selected NexGEN Gallery. This selected image will be displayed with the php function call showTitleimage(), which can be used inside your templates. The best place would be inside the index.php file directly after the get_header(); call.

The following parameters are accessible on the Tools->Titleimage administration page:

* State - switches the display of the titleimage on or off
* Gallery - select the NG Gallery
* Image selection - show the first or a random image from the selected gallery
* Max. image width &amp; Max. image height - ...
* Imagetitle - Switch the display of an image title on or off
* Title - an alternative image title (overwrites the image title given by the NextGEN Plugin)
* URL - A link for the title
* Style - Defines wether the default CSS or a individual CSS File should be used

You will find more information on [pixelshifter.de](http://www.pixelshifter.de), but for now in german language only ... sorry for that.
